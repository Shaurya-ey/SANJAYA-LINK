# VIDURA-LINK
VIDURA-LINK is a custom 1-Watt telemetry and control system built for drones, fixed-wing UAVs, and RC models. While standard ELRS or Crossfire modules are great, I wanted a transparent, fully customizable link based on the RP2040 and SX1262 that I could integrate directly into my own flight controllers and ground stations.
